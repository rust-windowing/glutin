 - **Breaking**: Removed `DisplayLost` variant to `ContextError`.
 - **Breaking**: Renamed `NotCurrentContext` to `NotCurrent`.
 - **Breaking**: Renamed `PossiblyCurrentContext` to `PossiblyCurrent`.
 - Added `treat_as_current` function.

# Version 0.21.0-rc1 (2019-04-07)

 - **Breaking:** Replaced `CreationErrorPair` enum variant with `CreationErrors`.
 - Added `Clone` to `ContextBuilder`.
 - Added headless example.
 - Removed internal code relating to libcaca.
 - Implemented `Debug` on all public facing types.
 - Dropping contexts on platforms using egl and/or glx no longer resets the
 current context, if the context dropped wasn't the current context.
 - Added context sharing support to MacOS.
 - **Breaking**: Removed `ContextTrait`.
 - **Breaking**: Renamed `OsMesaContextExt` to `HeadlessContextExt`. Added functions
 for using egl-surfaceless.
 - **Breaking**: Changed `WindowedContext` and `RawContext` into typedefs of
 `ContextWrapper`.
 - **Breaking**: Removed `new_windowed` and `new_headless` from `WindowedContext`
 and `Context`, respectively.
 - **Breaking**: Added two new types, `NotCurrentContext` and `PossiblyCurrentContext`,
 which `RawContext`, `WindowedContext`, `ContextBuilder` and `Context` are now
 generic over.
 - Added `{make,treat_as}_not_current` function to `{Raw,Windowed,}Context`.
 - We now load `libGL.so` instead of `libGLX.so`.
 - **Breaking**: Added `DisplayLost` variant to `ContextError`.
 - Fixed bug where we drop the hidden window belonging to a headless context on
 on X11 and/or Wayland before the actual context.
 - "Fixed" bug where we will close `EGLDisplay`s while they are still in use by
 others. Angry and/or salty rant can be found in `glutin/src/api/egl/mod.rs`,
 you can't miss it.
 - **Breaking**: `WindowedContext`s now deref to `Context`, not `Window`. 
 Please use `.window()` to access the window.

# Version 0.20.0 (2019-03-09)

- We no longer load `libEGL.so` and `libGL.so` multiple times.
- Fixes `Context::is_current` incorrectly returning `false`.
- Made `ContextBuilder`'s `pf_reqs` public.
- **Breaking:** Renamed `GlContext{,Ext}` to `ContextTrait{,Ext}`.
- **Breaking:** Renamed `GlWindow` to `WindowedContext`.
- Implemented context sharing support for Windows and Linux.
- Added support for contexts made from raw parts for Windows and Linux.
- **Breaking:** Removed `shareable_with_windowed_contexts`. Now you must build
OsMesa contexts via a separate extension.
- Added `ContextBuilder::build_{windowed,headless}` methods.
- **Breaking:** Renamed `Context::new` to `Context::new_headless`. `new_headless` now accepts dimensions for the off-screen surface backing it.
- **Breaking:** Renamed `GlWindow::new` to `WindowedContext::new_windowed`.
- On X11 and Wayland, you can now use shared contexts, however, one limitation
of the Wayland backend is that all shared contexts must use the same events
pool as each other.
- Added context sharing support to windows.
- Improved docs.
- Refactored code to be more consistent/cleaner. Ran rustfmt on everything.
- Added NetBSD support.
- **Breaking:** Removed `new_shared` function from `Context` and `GlWindow`, in favor of `new`.
- Added `build` method to `ContextBuilder`.
- Added `get_egl_display` method to `GlContextExt` trait and its implementation for platforms.
- Removed minimum supported Rust version guarantee.
- `NoBackendAvailable` is now `Sync`, as a result `CreationError` is also `Sync`.
