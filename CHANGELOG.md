# Version 0.31.1

- Fixed `CGLContextObj` having an invalid encoding on newer macOS versions.

# Version 0.31.0

- Bump MSRV from `1.60` to `1.65`.
- **Breaking:** `bitflags` which is used as a part of public API was updated to `2.0`.
- **Breaking:** `.*SurfaceAccessor` traits got removed; their methods now on respective `.*GlContext` traits instead.

# Version 0.30.10

- Add `X11VisualInfo::visual_id` to get `XID` of the visual.
- Added support for EGL on Windows using Angle. This assumes libEGL.dll/libGLESv2.dll present.

# Version 0.30.9

- Fixed lock on SwapBuffers with some GLX drivers.

# Version 0.30.8

- Fixed EGL dereferencing raw window handles on everything but X11 in legacy `Window` and `Pixmap` surface creation.
- On GLX, fixed startup failure when passing default `Flush` with `KHR_context_flush_control`.
- **Behavior change:** the `Config`'s `Api` now has platform specific default instead of being unspecified.

# Version 0.30.7

- Altered specification for `objc2` crate to pull patch update.

# Version 0.30.6

- Fixed EGL window/pixmap creation when using legacy path.

# Version 0.30.4

- Fixed EGL display initialization with XcbDisplayHandle.
- Fixed EGL/GLX `Surface::width` returning the height instead of the width.
- On GLX, fixed handling of errors not directly requested by glutin.
- Added `GlConfig::hardware_accelerated` to check if the config is hardware accelerated.
- Added `GlContext::context_api` to get the `ContextApi` used by the context.
- Added missing implementations of `Surface::{width,height}` for WGL/CGL
- Fixed crash when accessing context from the off-thread on macOS.
- **Clarified that `make_{,not}_current()`, `GlSurface::width()`, `GlSurface::height()`, and `GlSurface::resize()` could block on macOS.**

# Version 0.30.3

- Fixed wrong amount of rects commited in `Surface::swap_buffers_with_damage` with EGL.
- Added missing `Eq`, `PartialEq`, and `Hash` impls for `surface::Rect`.

- Added `EGLDevice` wrappers for EGL.
- Added EGL dependent api to make a context current without a surface.
- Added `supports_transparency` on `GlConfig`.
- On GLX, try all extensions when setting vsync.
- On WGL, fixed that `Surface::swap_buffers` takes longer with every call caused by frequent calls of the win32 function `HDC GetDC(HWND hWnd)`.

# Version 0.30.0

- **This version of `glutin` has been rewritten from the ground and no longer depends on `winit`, the `raw-window-handle` is now used instead of it.**
- The Api is now built around `Display`, `Surface`, `Config`, and `Surface`. For more info see crate documentation and examples.
- **Breaking:** Bump MSRV from `1.57` to `1.60`.
- The ios support was removed for the lack of maintainance for now. In case there's a need for it, contributions are welcome.
- The context creation is no longer limited to winit's supported platforms.
- The underlying Api providers are publically exposed now, so glutin could be used with just e.g. `EGL`.
- Fixed soundness issues with `Surface` MT safety, since before `EGLSurface` could be sent to a different thread, which is not safe.
- Fallback to `Surface::swap_buffers` when `Surface::swap_buffers_with_damage` is not supported on `EGL`.

# Version 0.29.1 (2022-08-10)

  - Replace `android_glue` dependency with `raw-window-handle`, and remove broken lifecycle event handling.
  - Glutin can now be used on Android, however, the application must ensure it only creates the `Context` following a winit `Event::Resumed` event, and destroys the `Context` in response to a `Event::Suspended` event.
