## Usage Examples

**Warning:** These are examples for `master`. You can find examples for
the latest _released version_ [here](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin/releases/tag/v0.30.9).

The examples use [`gl_generator`](https://crates.io/crates/gl_generator) to
generate OpenGL bindings.

### Try it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin
cd glutin
cargo run --example window
```

### Usage

Glutin is an OpenGL context creation library, and doesn't directly provide
OpenGL bindings for you.

For examples, please look [here](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin/tree/master/glutin_examples).

Note that glutin aims at being a low-level brick in your rendering
infrastructure. You are encouraged to write another layer of abstraction
between glutin and your application.

The minimum Rust version target by glutin is `1.60.0`.

## Platform-specific notes

### Android

Be sure to handle Android's lifecycle correctly when using a `winit` window
by only creating a GL surface after `winit` raises `Event::Resumed`, and
destroy it again upon receiving `Event::Suspended`. See this in action in the
[`android.rs` example](./glutin_examples/examples/android.rs).

To compile and run the Android example on your device,
install [`cargo-apk`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk)
and start the app using:

```console
$ cargo apk r -p glutin_examples --example android
```
