#![feature(unsafe_destructor)]

#![allow(unstable)]

//! The purpose of this library is to provide an OpenGL context on as many
//!  platforms as possible.
//!
//! # Building a window
//!
//! There are two ways to create a window:
//!
//!  - Calling `Window::new()`.
//!  - Calling `let builder = WindowBuilder::new()` then `builder.build()`.
//!
//! The first way is the simpliest way and will give you default values.
//!
//! The second way allows you to customize the way your window and GL context
//!  will look and behave.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! This crate has two Cargo features: `window` and `headless`.
//!
//!  - `window` allows you to create regular windows and enables the `WindowBuilder` object.
//!  - `headless` allows you to do headless rendering, and enables
//!     the `HeadlessRendererBuilder` object.
//!
//! By default only `window` is enabled.
